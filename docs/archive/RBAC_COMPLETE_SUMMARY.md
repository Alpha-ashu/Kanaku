##  Security Implementation

### Admin Email Lock
```typescript
// CANNOT be overridden by:
//  Environment variables
//  User metadata
//  API requests
//  LocalStorage manipulation
//  Only: shake.job.atgmail.com via email match
```

### Role Assignment (Cannot Be Changed by User)
```typescript
// Role is determined at login time by AuthContext
// Never:
//  Allow users to change their own role
//  Trust role from JWT without validation
//  Take role from request body/params
// Always:
//  Validate email matches hardcoded admin
//  Check configured advisor emails
//  Default to user for all others
```

### Backend Validation Required
```typescript
// Frontend checks are for UX only
// All endpoints MUST validate:
//  JWT token is valid
//  User role from token matches requirements
//  User owns the resource being accessed
//  Feature is accessible to this role
//  Action is permitted for this role
```

| **Beta**  |  |  |  | Advisor Feedback |
| **Released**  |  |  |  | Production/Public |
| **Deprecated**  |  |  |  | Hidden/Removal |

### Admin Control Panel
```
Admin can:
1. View all features and their current readiness
2. Click status button to change readiness
3. Changes are immediate
4. Visibility updates for all users
5. Get confirmation notification
```

4. Payment Completed
   Status: completed
   
5. Settlement to Advisor
   Total Amount:        $100  (from user)
   Platform Fee (10%):  -$10  (to platform)
   Advisor Settlement:  $90   (to advisor)
   
6. Notifications Sent
   User:    "payment_settled" ($100 charged)
   Advisor: "payment_received" ($90 received)
   
7. Transaction Record Created
   Debit:  User -$100
   Credit: Advisor +$90, Platform +$10

##  Quick Test Commands

### Test Admin Email Lock
```javascript

const { isAdminEmail } = require('./lib/rbac');
console.log(isAdminEmail('shake.job.atgmail.com')); // true
console.log(isAdminEmail('other@example.com'));   // false
```

### Test Feature Access
```javascript
const { hasFeatureAccess } = require('./lib/rbac');
console.log(hasFeatureAccess('admin', 'bookAdvisor'));    // true
console.log(hasFeatureAccess('advisor', 'bookAdvisor'));  // false
console.log(hasFeatureAccess('user', 'bookAdvisor'));     // true
```

### Test State Transitions
```javascript
const { isValidStateTransition } = require('./lib/sessionManagement');
console.log(isValidStateTransition('pending', 'accepted'));   // true
console.log(isValidStateTransition('pending', 'active'));     // false
console.log(isValidStateTransition('active', 'cancelled'));   // true
```

### Test Payment Calculation
```javascript
const { calculatePlatformSplit } = require('./lib/paymentSettlement');
const { platformFee, advisorSettlement } = calculatePlatformSplit(1000);
console.log(platformFee);          // 100 (10%)
console.log(advisorSettlement);    // 900 (90%)
```
